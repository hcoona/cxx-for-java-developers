# Syntax and Semantics

## Declarations vs. Definitions, Header Files

Because of limitations of ancient C/C++ compilers, the language separated declarations of functions/types from their definitions. During compilation you only need the declarations (signatures) everywhere, and then at link time all the generated code is put together. Today (before C++ Modules are universally adopted) we still follow this: for any function/type that is not confined to the current translation unit, you first declare it, then use it.

In C++ the convention is:

- Use files ending with `.h` to hold declarations.
- Use files ending with `.cc` / `.cpp` to hold implementations.
- Use `.inc` for textual fragments that are meant to be `#include`d (data tables, code snippets, etc.).

/// admonition | Note
If a function or class template is used, its implementation must live in the header file (so that the compiler can instantiate it when needed).
///

```cpp
--8<-- ".snippets/syntax-and-semantics/001-header-impl-example.cc:code"
```

## Package and Namespace

C++ uses namespaces to achieve an effect similar to Java packages. There is no package-visible access level in C++.

## Read-Only Qualifiers

Currently C++ has these related specifiers:

1. `const`
2. `constexpr`
3. `consteval` (C++20)
4. `constinit` (C++20)

### The `const` Specifier

`const` has two meanings:

1. Produce a read-only variant of a type (e.g. from `int32_t` to `const int32_t`).
2. Declare something as a constant object.

For meaning (1) see: Programming Language -> Type System -> Read-only Types. For meaning (2) see: Programming Language -> Type System -> Constants.

### The `constexpr`, `consteval`, and `constinit` Specifiers

Because the two meanings of `const` can be ambiguous, C++ introduced `constexpr` to separate (2). Recommendation: always use `const` for (1) and `constexpr` for (2).

However, `constexpr` itself has two uses:

1. Declare a constant object.
2. Declare that a function may be evaluated at compile time (loosely speaking; see the precise rules at <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constexpr>).

Use case (2) was further split out into `consteval`.

Use case (1) still has deeper subtleties. Earlier we mentioned: do not declare a `std::string` constant (but declaring a `char*` constant is fine). There are deeper issues here: can a `std::string` be created at compile time? If not, how do we create a constant of type `std::string`? Are there destructor constraints? To address initialization of non-trivial types as constants, C++20 added `constinit`. See <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constinit> for details.

## Virtual Functions: `final` and `override`

In Java you can use `final` to prevent a class from being subclassed or a method from being overridden. C++ uses the same `final` keyword.

Java uses the `@Override` annotation to mark an overriding method. C++ goes further and adds the `override` specifier.

```cpp
--8<-- ".snippets/syntax-and-semantics/002-virtual-final-override.cc:code"
```

## Interface Types and Pure Virtual Functions

C++ has no separate "interface" construct. An abstract class with no data members can conceptually serve as an interface. Since C++ permits multiple inheritance, this usage is workable. A pure virtual function is declared like this:

```cpp
--8<-- ".snippets/syntax-and-semantics/003-pure-virtual-interface.cc:code"
```

/// admonition | Note
When you design interface-like or abstract base types (similar to Java style), you normally follow "reference semantics" guidelines:

1. Disable copying.
2. Provide a virtual destructor.
3. (Preferably) allow move.
///

## Pass by Value, Pointer, Reference

In Java, primitives are passed by value and other types behave like references. In C++ it depends on the semantic design of each type; see: Programming Language -> Type System -> Custom Types -> (copy-by) value semantic types / reference semantic types.

Except where a pointer is explicitly required by convention (e.g., to indicate optional ownership transfer or C APIs), avoid raw pointers. To represent an optional value prefer `std::optional`; see Programming Language -> Type System -> `std::optional`.

## RAII, Ownership, and Move Semantics

RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) is analogous to Java's try-with-resources. You control a resource via an object's lifetime. In Java you might manage a file resource like this:

```java
--8<-- ".snippets/syntax-and-semantics/004-raii-java-example.java:code"
```

When the `try` block ends, `BufferedReader.close()` is invoked automatically to release the OS file handle. Similarly, in C++ you can perform the cleanup inside the destructor:

```cpp
--8<-- ".snippets/syntax-and-semantics/005-raii-cpp-example.cc:code"
```

In C++ we often allocate small objects on the stack; their lifetime is bound to scope. Sometimes we need to transfer the managed resource out of the current scope to another owner. In that case we need move semantics to "transfer" the internals of an object to another.

```cpp
--8<-- ".snippets/syntax-and-semantics/006-move-semantics.cc:code"
```

## Operator Overloading

C++ allows operator overloading. Common use cases:

1. Overload copy/assignment operator (see Programming Language -> Type System -> Custom Types -> (copy-by) value semantic / reference semantic types).
2. Overload comparison operators for natural ordering of custom data types.
3. Overload the function call operator `()` for functors (so an instance can be invoked like a function).
4. Overload `[]` for custom containers.
5. Overload `<<` for logging / streaming output.

/// admonition | Note
Avoid assigning bizarre semantics to operators that change the normal syntactic expectations of C++. Although this can build clever DSLs, teammates unfamiliar with the background can easily misuse them. If it is not too complex, prefer plain functions to build DSLsâ€”they make intent clear.
///

Two styles exist for overloading operators: member functions and non-member (often `friend`) functions:

```cpp
--8<-- ".snippets/syntax-and-semantics/007-operator-overload-declarations.cc:code"
```

If you need access to private members, you usually must use a `friend` function.

### Equality Comparable and Hash Function

```cpp
--8<-- ".snippets/syntax-and-semantics/008-equality-comparable.cc:code"
```

Often after defining equality you also want to use the type as a key in hash-based containers. Provide a hash function; leveraging Abseil's Hash library is recommended:

```cpp
--8<-- ".snippets/syntax-and-semantics/009-absl-hash-circle.cc:code"
```

### Strict Weak Ordering (Partial Order)

```cpp
--8<-- ".snippets/syntax-and-semantics/010-strict-weak-order.cc:code"
```

### Total Ordering

A total order must satisfy the constraints listed at: <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concepts/totally_ordered>

A common pattern: first implement a `compareTo()`-like function, then implement the operators in terms of it:

```cpp
--8<-- ".snippets/syntax-and-semantics/011-total-order.cc:code"
```

With C++20 you can use the new three-way comparison operator `<=>`:

```cpp
--8<-- ".snippets/syntax-and-semantics/012-spaceship-operator.cc:code"
```

## Lambda Expressions

C++ lambdas are similar to Java's but require you to explicitly list which variables to capture and how (by copy, by reference, or other special forms). A blanket capture of everything (`[&]` or `[=]`) is generally discouraged.

```cpp
--8<-- ".snippets/syntax-and-semantics/013-lambda-capture.cc:code"
```

## (Emphasized) Free Functions in C++

C++ functions need not live inside a class. So do not write Java-like utility classes:

```java
--8<-- ".snippets/syntax-and-semantics/014-java-util-class.java:code"
```

```cpp
--8<-- ".snippets/syntax-and-semantics/015-cpp-static-class.cc:code"
```

Just write the free function directly:

```cpp
--8<-- ".snippets/syntax-and-semantics/016-cpp-free-function.cc:code"
```
