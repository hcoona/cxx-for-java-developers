SUMMARY
-------
This repository contains two categories of content:
1. Source code examples, scripts, and build/configuration artifacts ("Code").
2. Tutorials, guides, narrative text, and other static/media documentation assets ("Documentation").

Licensing policy:
- Code is licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0. See `LICENSE-APACHE-2.0.txt`.
- Documentation is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0). See `LICENSE-CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0.txt`.

SCOPE
-----
Unless a file header or directory explicitly states a different license:
- The following are treated as "Code" (Apache-2.0 applies):
  * All files ending in .c .cc .cpp .cxx .h .hpp .hxx .inl
  * All build/automation related scripts and configs ending in .py .ps1 .sh .bat .cmd .js .ts .cmake .txt (when used as build scripts)
  * `CMakeLists.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, and other toolchain/build related configuration files (e.g. *.yml *.yaml *.json)
- The following are treated as "Documentation" (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 applies):
  * `README.md`
  * All Markdown / images / style assets / static site generation resources under `docs/`, EXCEPT the following "Code Snippet Directories":
    - `docs/.snippets/` and its subdirectories
    - Any hidden snippet subdirectories matching `docs/**/.snippets/`
    - Subdirectories named `snippets`, `samples`, or `examples` intended purely for source code examples
    Source code files inside these Code Snippet Directories (and content synchronized / transcluded from them into Documentation) are classified as Code and fall under Apache-2.0.
  * All generated static site files under `site/`

Embedded / extracted code blocks:
If Documentation (files within the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 scope) contains explicitly fenced code blocks, or code automatically pulled from the above Code Snippet Directories, those code blocks are licensed under Apache-2.0. You may reuse them independently with proper attribution and a link to the original repository.
